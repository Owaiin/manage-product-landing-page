# FrontendMentor Test [Live](https://manage-landing-page-template.netlify.app/)

I took this one on to see how close I can get to the design of the landing page on Frontend Mentor with just html, css, and vanilla JS.
I'm pretty happy with the outcome but feel like there's a better solution out there for the background tablet placement on the lower half of the page.

Some elements were missing from the asset file (like a white font logo for the footer), so I just made do with what was there.
